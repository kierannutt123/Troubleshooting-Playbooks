# Troubleshooting Playbooks

This repository contains practical troubleshooting reference material commonly used in IT support and junior infrastructure roles.  
The diagrams focus on identifying symptoms, likely causes, and structured resolution steps for common hardware, software, and network issues.

The content is designed to reflect real-world support workflows rather than theoretical explanations, and can be used as quick-reference material during incident investigation.

workflow using Zendesk:
